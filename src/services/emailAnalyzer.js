Using ONLY these priorities, decide "notify": should Wingman message the user on WhatsApp about THIS email right now? Be selective — say true only when it genuinely matches what they care about (an important person, an important topic, a query/decision/reply they'd want to know about). Routine, promotional or FYI mail → false.
If true, write "notify_message": a short, natural WhatsApp note FROM Wingman TO the user (first person, warm, concise) that says who it's from, what they want, and what you'd suggest — then offer to help or draft a reply. Example tone: "📧 <name> emailed about <topic> — they're asking <what>. Want me to draft a reply?" Keep it to 2–4 lines. If notify is false, set notify_message to "".`;

detected_type guidance:
- "bill" = an invoice/statement the user still needs to PAY (has an amount due and usually a due date).
- "payment_receipt" = confirmation a payment ALREADY went through (words like "payment received", "receipt", "thank you for your payment", "your card was charged"). Set company and amount so the matching bill can be cleared. Do NOT mark these as "bill".
